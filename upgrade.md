**Short, clear, realistic answer about *Nature Machine Intelligence* (Nat Mach Intell):**

---

# **Is Nature Machine Intelligence realistic for your computational-only work?**

**Yes — it is plausible**, but the bar is **very different** from JACS or JCIM.

Nat Mach Intell does **not require wet-lab validation**, but it **does require ML novelty**, not just ML application.

Here is the decisive framing:

---

# **What Nat Mach Intell actually wants**

Papers in NMI usually fall into at least **one** of these categories:

### **(1) New ML Methodology**

Examples:

* novel geometric learning architectures
* new physics-informed models
* new sampling or generative approaches
* new equivariant inference frameworks

### **(2) Transformational Application of ML**

Examples:

* ML achieving something previously unattainable by simulation
* ML changing a field’s workflow (drug design, materials, chemistry)
* ML revealing mechanisms or structure that simulation cannot

### **(3) ML + Scientific Insight Combination**

Example:

* ML uncovers cryptic folding mechanism → validated by MD or analysis

# **Where Your Current Proposal Stands**

Your pitch now is roughly:

> “Use DeepSurf + DiffDock + OpenMM-lite to replicate Anton-scale allosteric fragment binding at low compute cost.”

This is:

* technically interesting,
* impactful for drug modeling,
* novel in **application**,

But **not novel in ML methodology.**

So in current form, Nat Mach Intell editors will say:

* **Strong application**
* **Weak ML novelty**

And likely redirect to **JCIM / JCTC / Nat Comm (Comp)**

---

# **How to Make It NMI-Level (Feasible with No Wet Lab)**

You need to add one of these **three** ML-driven elements:

---

### **Path A: ML Generates Dynamics Surrogates**

If you:

1. Train a model to **predict side-chain rearrangements**
2. Or **sample cryptic pocket dynamics**
3. Or **approximate MD trajectories**

From static structures + ML,

Then you are doing **machine learning for simulation replacement**, which NMI loves.

There are already **materials, fluid dynamics, QM surrogate** analogs published there.

---

### **Path B: ML + Physics Hybrid**

If you:

* combine **SE(3) diffusion models** with **short MD refinement**, and
* **prove acceleration** of sampling cryptic pockets,

You get a **hybrid physics–ML contribution**.

NMI is receptive because it touches **accelerated simulation**, **physics constraints**, and **scientific insight**.

---

### **Path C: Algorithmic/Architectural Novelty**

If you invent a small but real improvement:

* pocket-conditioned diffusion docking
* equivariant scoring with dynamic pocket priors
* fragment-aware geometry networks

Then the **ML novelty** box is checked.

No wet-lab required for this route.

---

# **Minimal NMI-Ready Storyline (No Wet Lab)**

One candidate arc that could work for you is:

1. **Problem:** Cryptic pockets require μs MD (Anton).
2. **Method:** New **equivariant fragment–pocket diffusion model + MD-lite refinement**.
3. **Result:** Surrogates capture **side-chain reorderings** correlated with Anton MD.
4. **Impact:** Enables **orders-of-magnitude cheaper** cryptic pocket exploration.

This hits NMI criteria:

* ML novelty (diffusion + equivariance + conditioning)
* Scientific insight (cryptic pocket dynamics)
* Practical impact (no Anton required)

# **Reality Check: Acceptance Probability**

If you add **innovative ML**, here’s realistic probability:

| Journal                  | Acceptance Chance                    | Reason                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Nat Mach Intell**      | **Medium** (if ML novelty added)     | ML–science crossover                |
| **Nat Commun / Sci Adv** | **Medium–High**                      | transformational application        |
| **JCIM / JCTC**          | **High**                             | computational chemistry application |
| **JACS**                 | **Effectively zero** w/o experiments | chemical validation gap             |

So NMI is achievable **without wet lab**, **if you emphasize ML novelty**, not chemistry.

---

# **If You Proceed as-is (No ML Novelty)**

Then the cleanest publication path is:

* **bioRxiv**
* **JCIM / JCTC**

This is 100% respectable and realistic.

---

# **Conclusion (in one sentence)**

**Nature Machine Intelligence is a viable target for your work only if you elevate it from an ML application to an ML methodology or hybrid ML–simulation contribution; without that shift, the correct tier is JCIM/JCTC.**

If you want, I can now help with:

A) reframing your concept into an **NMI-compatible ML story**,
or
B) building the **JCIM/JCTC manuscript structure**,
or
C) upgrading the pipeline to **hybrid ML–physics surrogate**.

Just reply **A**, **B**, or **C**.
