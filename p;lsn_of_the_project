Absolutely — that’s the correct scientific instinct. We **run experiments → review results → iterate → publish**, not the other way around. Let’s switch into a practical, execution-focused mode.

Below is a clean, minimalistic plan to **get results first**, without overcommitting to a publication narrative yet.

---

# Step 1. Define “Results” We Need Before Deciding Anything Else

To meaningfully judge whether this approach works, we need 4 types of outputs:

**(A) Pocket Detection Results**

* Do AI models find the same pockets that Anton MD + crystallography found?
* Specifically PTP1B pockets:

  * Pocket 1 (DES-4799)
  * Pocket 2 (DES-4884)

**(B) Pose Prediction Results**

* For DES-4799, DES-4884, & fragment variants
* Compare AI-generated poses to crystal structure poses

**(C) Side-Chain Conformational Recovery**

* Especially Phe196 & Phe280 “swing-out” rearrangement for Pocket 2

**(D) Compute Efficiency**

* GPU hours vs Anton μs MD benchmark (just to quantify feasibility)

If we get good signal on (A)+(B)+(C), then we improvise and push further.

If (A) or (B) fails hard → we pivot or enhance (not publish).

---

# Step 2. Minimum Viable Setup to Produce Results

To avoid heavy engineering, we can do this in the following order:

---

## **(1) Data Collection & Prep (1–2 days)**

What we need:

* PTP1B apo structure → use PDB: **2CM2** (same starting structure used in paper)
* Fragment structures → extract from uploaded paper (names: DES-4799, DES-4884, DES-5742, DES-5743, DES-6016)

Crystal structures for validation:

* PDBs: **8G65, 8G67, 8G68, 8G69, 8G6A** (published in paper)

We will use these only **after inference** to avoid cheating.

---

## **(2) Pocket Detection (2–4 hours GPU)**

Run **MaSIF-site** and/or **DeepSurf** on:

* Apo PTP1B (2CM2)

Expected success criterion:

* Models highlight two pocket regions consistent with MD and crystal complexes.

---

## **(3) Pose Generation (≤ 1 hour GPU)**

Use **DiffDock** to propose fragment poses for each pocket.

Inputs:

* Protein + fragment SMILES

Outputs:

* Top-N (say N=20) poses + confidence scores

---

## **(4) Local Refinement (optional but helpful)**

Use:

* SCWRL / Rosetta Relax / FastRelax
* Only refine local pocket residues, not whole protein

Goal:

* Check if Phe196/Phe280 rearrangements are energetically favorable

---

## **(5) Validation (CPU/GPU-light)**

Now load crystal structures **only for comparison**, compute:

* RMSD (fragment heavy atom)
* RMSD (pocket residues)
* χ1/χ2 errors for Phe196/Phe280

No ML training, no big pipeline, just results.

---

# Step 3. What We Look for in the First Results

These 3 yes/no questions determine next steps:

---

### **Q1. Did models detect the right pockets without MD?**

Expected success if:

* One of detected pockets overlaps Pocket 1 (DES-4799)
* Another overlaps Pocket 2 (DES-4884)

Failure mode:

* Only active site gets detected (not helpful for fragments)

---

### **Q2. Do pose models place fragments near the experimental sites?**

Success if:

* For DES-4799: poses localize near Ser80, Ser205, His208, Gly209 region
* For DES-4884: poses near Asn193 + hydrophobic cavity

Failure mode:

* DiffDock drops fragment on active site instead of allosteric

We don’t need perfect RMSD — correct region is enough for first pass.

---

### **Q3. Does local refinement produce side-chain rearrangements?**

Specifically:

* Phe196 χ1 rotation
* Phe280 swing-out

This is the **most biologically interesting** signal.

Expected outcome:

* Even if raw ML doesn’t rotate side-chains, refinement may

If these rearrangements don’t appear → we decide whether to:

* Add rotamer sampling
* Add AF2-multimer refinement
* Add PELE / MD-lite simulations

---

# Step 4. Success/Failure Decision Table

| Result                                         | Interpretation    | Next Step                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Pocket detection YES, Pose YES, Side-chain YES | **Strong signal** | Polish → expand → bioRxiv                 |
| Pocket detection YES, Pose YES, Side-chain NO  | **Medium signal** | Add refinement step → retest              |
| Pocket detection YES, Pose NO                  | **Partial**       | Add pocket-biased diffusion / constraints |
| Pocket detection NO                            | **Weak**          | Try DeepSurf/Fpocket-ML / ensembles       |

No wasted work — immediate iterations.

---

# Step 5. Hardware & Tools for Results

This is all **GPU-light**:

**Pocket Detection**

* MaSIF-site → 3090/4090/T4 okay

**Pose Prediction**

* DiffDock → runs on notebook GPUs

**Refinement**

* Rosetta Relax → mostly CPU
* SCWRL → CPU only

**Validation**

* MDTraj / PyMol / ProDy scripts → CPU

No training, no supercomputer, no cluster.

---

# Step 6. Once Results Are In — How We “Improvise”

Depending on what we see, improvisation could mean:

* Try alternative models (e.g. EquiBind / TANKBind)
* Add ensemble conformers (AF2 / NMR) for cryptic site sampling
* Integrate PELE or short MD for rotamer sampling
* Try weak supervision for ranking poses

We keep engineering proportional to results.

---

# Step 7. Quick Recap of the Plan

**We are going to:**

1. Prep proteins + fragments
2. Run pocket detection
3. Run pose generation
4. Run local refinement
5. Validate vs crystal
6. Decide next move

**We are NOT going to:**

* Overbuild infrastructure
* Write manuscripts prematurely
* Commit to training massive models

# Actionable Next Step (If You Want Results Soon)

To start running this, I need to know one thing from you:

**Which platform will we run on?**

Choose one:

**Option 1:** Local GPU (e.g., 3090/4090/4080)
**Option 2:** Cloud GPU (AWS/GCP/Runpod/Paperspace)
**Option 3:** University HPC cluster
**Option 4:** You want me to recommend cheapest cloud route

Reply with:

> Option X, and here’s our hardware: …

or

> Recommend best Option + ballpark budget

After that, I’ll give you:

* Setup instructions
* Environment spec
* Repro pipeline

And then we run and see what happens — no theoretical BS, just execution and data.

Ready when you are.
